Post-quantum signing SDK for Python. Signs and verifies any payload using **ML-DSA-65** (NIST FIPS 204) — resistant to Shor's algorithm, standardized by NIST in August 2024.

**Not just for auth.** Sign users, orders, documents, devices, AI agents, events — any entity that needs a tamper-proof, quantum-resistant signature.

## Install

```bash
pip install fipsign-sdk
```

For async support (httpx-based):

```bash
pip install fipsign-sdk[async]
```

## Quick start

1. Create a free account at [app.fipsign.dev](https://app.fipsign.dev).
2. In the dashboard, create a project, then create an API key inside it. Save the key — it won't be shown again.
3. Use it:

```python
from fipsign import PQAuth

pq = PQAuth("pqa_your_api_key")

result = pq.sign("user_123", role="admin")
token  = result.token

verified = pq.verify(token)
if not verified.valid:
    raise PermissionError("invalid token")

print(verified.payload["sub"])  # "user_123"
```

That's signing and verifying. The SDK also covers async usage (`AsyncPQAuth`), Flask/FastAPI middleware, offline (in-memory) verification, revocation, webhooks, and a full Certificate Authority module (PQCert + X.509) for issuing post-quantum certificates to devices and services — all in the [developer guide](https://fipsign.dev/guide).

## Why ML-DSA-65?

JWT with RS256/ES256 and standard OAuth tokens rely on ECDSA or RSA — both breakable by Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. ML-DSA-65 is based on lattice problems (Module-LWE / Module-SIS) with no known quantum speedup. Standardized by NIST in August 2024 as FIPS 204.
